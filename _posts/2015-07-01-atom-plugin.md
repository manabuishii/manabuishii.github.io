[Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom") is nice editor.

Sometimes directory has binary files and sourcecode.

But sometimes I don't want to edit binary file (such as xslx, docx, zip, and more)

Atom has nice plugin

* [tree-view-filter](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view-filter "tree-view-filter")

this plugin filtering tree view list.
